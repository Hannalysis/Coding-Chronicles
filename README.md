After finishing up this week's module in SoC on AI & Data, I looked into utilising JavaScript snippets, and recapped on certain aspects of Chrome's DevTools.

I spent today creating fetch functionality, and utilising the appropriate information inside the response data to display on a webpage, utilising a JavaScript snippet.  The challenge with this, came with where I wanted to add this data - inside an accordion as an additional item.  
It was not that straightforward to mimic it's visuals nor behaviour, as the class setup is quite extensive, and I would not have been surprised if there is some coding functionality going on under the hood that I was just unable to re-create.  
I ended up obtaining close visuals, and full functionality, so the items displayed appropriated once said accordion item was expanded, and hidden when it was closed up.

After the day at SoC (first day of final project week!) , I finished up the code from yesterday, and gave last minute small adjustements so it was more readable (especially with a few dom manipulation variables!). I also added error handling that could be displayed on the web page (also via the snippet).   
  
I also decided to record a quick video, to practice my video editing skills - which also gave me a chance to get familiar with Da Vinci Resolve for the first time.  Note: First impressions, it's much more flexible than both clipChamp and OpenShot Editor.

During SoC, we transitioned from our initial planning phase, to setting out our Tech Stack, PWA, MVP and rough Wireframing.  

We spent quite a bit of time there due to having to edit our original vision, as our expectations of utilising an API from OS was quite restricting and we thought it would take a long time to manipulate it in a way that would solve our problem statement.

Today was our first build day. I took my role as lead and made sure we had a task list of issues made in github, and appropriately assigned to everyone.  I made sure everyone had a clear idea of what their priorities were and whether they had enough information to execute our tasks.  

We then divided and conquered, and I spent time helping my colleague with some initial tailwinding, and understanding our current code we'd been pulling down from other members as the merges to main came in.  
After some thorough navigation and liasing with the rest of my members at various intervals, I found some time in the evening to style our google places images - and that was no easy feat.  
Ultimately, I had to create containers to manipulate the images indirectly, and accept that the location information would not be displayed inside the boxes (as it affected the images too much). If everyone agrees, I will take the text outside of that component and display it underneath instead, if its needed.

Full on hackathon day today!  

I started by taking on one of my roles the nominated decision maker, which also allowed an easy format to drive our next steps, priorities and written issues that required populating, delegating and requesting a window for an update with other members.  

I then focused on updating the front-end with one of my team members for the day, and managed to get a clean and uniform visual display, in a format that suits mobile devices first.  

With the app in a good space by the EoD, I took responsibility to flesh out a detailed readme as one of the repo's final touches, ready to merge to main the folllowing morning.

Today was full on presentation planning and presentation day with an official webinar, to showcase in front of potential employers.  
I was fully knackered after that and a SoC online social, so I took the evening off to rest.

I had to take yesterday off, I was brain-dead, exhausted, not just from the week at SoC but from everything that was going on outside of that too (what timing!).  

Today I started with getting some code articulation practice with a fellow developer, with my code-snippet I created a few days prior.  

I then spent the rest of my coding session creating a lesson plan for a Python tutorial - and also created the project exercise in question.

After the post SoC Employability session, and post tech-test interview, I needed a break before getting back to work.  

I managed to get back to my Python tutorial - refined the project I want to teach; by simplifying the code, and abtsracting away a couple of lengthy functions that take away from the focus of the learnings from the lesson. 

I updated my plan of action, and a flow of the expected execution of code order. I will start tomorrow by finding how best to break these down into segments and which area of code would make sense to teach from beginning to end.

I spent today working on my Python tutorial.  

I broke down the code into small segments - to enable a focus for each segment of the tutorial.  I then wrote each code challenge in a separate segment to complement the segment that completes it.  
This was a surprisingly time consuming process, and involved going back to the drawing (figma) board to adjust my planning and make sure I was record-ready for tomorrow.

So today was the recording session.  

It took me alot longer than I thought, and I realised this tutorial is longer than I had expected. However, after a few hours (and many piecemeal re-takes) we've got a tutorial with full audio, and visual vs code throughout the timeline, with the appropriate challenges appearing as and when.  
Tomorrow, will be the major editing session - and trying to fit in some additional visuals inside the timeline if possible.  
If I get time, I will also pack-up supplements, finish the documentation and it will be ready to submit!

Today I spent the best of the day editing the session - once pieced together, it was surprisingly double what I was expecting; a 14 minute video!

This week has been surprisingly intensive. So I spent today doing some minor tweaks to my main CV template, and updating with last week's SoC final project.  
I finished the day with uploading a couple of old Python projects, and will likely start a small-scale one over the weekend to incorporate some data visualisations.

Yesterday, was a very much needed rest and reset - with only a sprinkle of code planning in preparation for today.  

So, I wanted to start to see what catering towards a junior data analytical role could look like. Even though I've completed many small scale projects in Python, I am yet to showcase any data visualisations (outside of my personal project which is ironically not utilising a Python module).  

So today I started exploring into generating heatmaps, and what would be best served as a front-end for it.  
I quickly discovered streamlit, which, even though I currently intend to utilise locally for the time being, I could utilise their deployment services in the future and as when I needed to.  So I started with testing dummy data with Seaborn to check the basic functionality.  

Once I started delving into what particular datasets would I like to showcase, I realised that basic heatmaps may not be enough.   
When geospatial visualisations are required, I discovered the Folium module which, also happened to work alongside Streamlit as it has it's own module (streamlit_folium) with the st_folium function to allow the map to render with Streamlit.  So I tested this visual with more dummy data and decided that this (or a combination of this and basic heatmaps) would be perfect for my dataset of choice.  

I managed to end the day with a basic MVP; a modestly sized data sample in a dataframe, a geospatial map, and an accompanying readme for future milestones for my new project winds-of-change.

After an intensive day yesterday, I looked at my prioities for today, and decided to keep it short.  

I started with branching off from my CV repo, in both a data-analysis & front-end focused directions, in order to tailor appropriate project content for those applications.  I also noticed I had not yet forked and created a readme for one of the relevant hackathons, so I bashed that out and added it to my front-end CV.

With my time available today, I started to plan my portfolio website!  

I managed to decide the domain site, hosting options, tech stack, and did some mock up frames for what a mobile first portfolio site could look like.  I also chose a colour scheme and theme.  With what I had, I wanted to experiement with component ideas, so I played with the v0 tool, asked it to create some framer motion and css animated transitions to see what could work for me.  
So, even though I'm not using Next.js for my portfolio site, it's proving a very useful playground to tinker with some visual designs!

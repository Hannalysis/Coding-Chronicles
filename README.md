Despite a shorter study week, as of today I managed to complete the 'Analyzing Data in Tableau' course in Datacamp.  
This was the last prerequisite course on the Tableau career track, meaning I can finally start the 'Data Visualization in Tableau' course.  

I'm pleasantly surprised how much I got out of that course, namely the chapter 'Mapping Analysis'. Working with analysing geodata was directly relevant to my WoC project, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it can do to enhance it's visual output options.  
  
I also went back to an old React flashcards project, to replace the original form component and utilise the react-hook-form library instead.

Naturally, after waiting a week to post an update, I do a bit of additional study today and I've learnt just as much in a shorter period of time!  

Firstly, I completed the second chapter of the 'Data Visualization in Tableau', which focused on improving visualisations to make them more readable, and removing redundant or repeated information where necessary.   
I also learnt how to embed a tooltip visualisation within another visualisation, as well as using an url object on a dashboard to access more information from a site with a hover action.  This is inspiring me with my follow up data projects.  

And last but not least, I implemented an image decoration behind a set of buttons on the colab quiz project, and in front of a gradient background. I struggled a bit at first with the placement (not the layer), until I realised I could use the absolute CSS property to stop the pushing and pulling of other elements!

Today I'm pleased I managed to progress through the last two chapters of the 'Data Visualization in Tableau'.  

I got to explore more geospatial charts, and further looks into dashboard creations, and finally got my first introduction to stories in Tableau. I had a great time, and I'm very much looking forward to utilising this tool in my data project.  

As I had a couple of hours left this afternoon, I decided to update my website: I realised that adding new learning pieces was chunky in how I had to manually edit the objects and ids, so today I had to address it.  
So I refactored the component; abstracted away the TypeScript object declarations, and more importantly, moved the data objects from the tsx file, and dynamically added id onto the imported data objects (timeline items).  Oh my word, its such a time saver. I should have done this earlier. 
It also got me to look at my source code for my website and I've created a new github issue to refactor on more of a global scale, next time I'm focusing on this project again.  

Data Analyst in Tableau career track: 33% complete.

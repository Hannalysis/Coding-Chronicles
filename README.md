Last couple of weeks ended up being especially busy, and I only managed to get a day to work on my own personal project.  

However, this week has a lot more scope for progression! So today, I started with continuing the Relic colab project! I spent most of the day working on the MVP wireframe and design in figma.  

I deliberately wanted to be careful and ensure spacing is appropriate thanks to the grid layout, that reusable components are created and stored into their own page, along with design tokens, templates, sizing & typography details.  

I'm pleased to say I managed to finish the MVP figma design for the suggested page (minus an element that's very much out of scope for now), including renaming all layers/items so it's easy to follow (I've learnt from looking at certain community figmas that consistently renamed items are so much easier to follow and understand for implementation).  I even managed to create a progress node bar component in figma, which I previously only really knew how to do in CSS.

Yesterday took a surprising amount of energy, so I was glad today was more of a joint review on the Relic project, making follow-up changes to my work before allowing the current planning and design tasks to be completed. We're almost ready to start coding! 

So I spent the remainder of the afternoon returning to the Front-End Engineer career path in codecademy - 30% complete. Today was mostly recapping responsive website design & animations in CSS.

For the rest of the week I've split my focus a little. I've sorted out branch rules and deployed the initial app for the Relic colab, as well as having a PR to review for the first time.  

Otherwise I've been focused on my new personal project; and I've just got a Typography system implemented and design token variables in place. I'm almost ready to deploy and work on the Layout component.

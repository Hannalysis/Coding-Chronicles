After a full day of designing, and a limited timeframe, I wanted to utilise AI to help me build the foundations of this site. However, the one I rely on will not allow for further prompts until 2 days time. Not great timing. So I opted to try a different one.  
Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the alternative, as despite carefully crafting an essay prompt, the AI only implemented each component one at a time, and it costed me a message to agree for it to create the new component.  And I'm looking at the results for what I have so far, thinking, it's alot to edit.  

Doable of course, but not in a day (not to a degree where's its demoable). Time frame aside now, this may develop into a side project of it's own, and be a foundation for improving my motion animation skills in the near future instead.  

With that in mind, I decided to end the day with two pomodoro's of 'Learning TypeScript'. I've now completed the section on type narrowing, and using examples of type guarding with if / else or if and simply return statements. 86% Complete.

After a day or so of focusing on my CV and job focus, I decided to come back to learning some coding fundamentals today.  

So I decided to finish my 'Learning TypeScript' course in Codecademy, which focused on advanced object typing. This included optional type members, and the implements and extends keywords for class creation.  
Overall, this section was not as difficult as I thought it would be. It feels good to have the course completed, as it drew my attention to an area of TypeScript I am struggling with: complex types. So this will be great to take a note of, to revisit at some point.  

After that, I ended the day by adding content to my Continued Learning section of my portfolio site, and decided to add a couple of meta tags to my index. Unfortunately the og: image is not rendering at an appropriate size, so I'll look into fixing that next time I look at my site.

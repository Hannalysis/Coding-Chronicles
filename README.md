Turns out, that small cold evolved into a full-blown flu! Not my favourite start to the year, however I'm finally over the worst of it and ready to lightly get back to the coding journey :) 

After being recommended the Frontend Unicorn ebook (amongst many others!), I'm starting today with a nice chill reading session over most of the introductory sections.  
Going forward, my aim is to read 1 or 2 chapters to start my day before going into any practical learning or project sessions.  

Note: I seem to have not mentioned that I learnt what kerning is at some point during the festive period, so writing it here - the spacing between two letters in a text. Most typefaces are well-designed that it's not a concern, however it can be useful when for editing header or title text.

I've continued my reading of Frontend Unicorn over the last couple of days, and I'm already 25% through.  
So I thought I would label a learning/takeaway from each of the recent sections:

DESIGN - 12 column web grids are the standard for desktop. This also allows to create sections on the site into the most possible broken down configurations (1,2,3,4 or 6 width of equal section widths). 

COLOURS - Avoid colours that are saturated over 90%. 

TYPOGRAPHY - Best shape for short centered text is a triangle. Single column forms are better for a single path to follow with your eyes.  

BUTTONS - At least 1W of padding for each side of a button label (best to go for 2xW).  Min size: 44x44 mobile | 32x32 desktop.

To keep expanding my data knowledge, I completed a high-level course yesterday on 'Marketing Analytics for Business' with Datacamp. This gave me an overview of campaign analysis, privacy implications, text analysis & forecasting requirements. 
As the course itself was a little dry, I also weaved in some front-end reading (which continued into today).  

And today, I updated my site - as I realised one of my continued learning cards was not displaying all information appropriately. Turns out, one of my entries within my data file utilised the incorrect property name for the 'course' type.

After finishing up this week's module in SoC on AI & Data, I looked into utilising JavaScript snippets, and recapped on certain aspects of Chrome's DevTools.

I spent today creating fetch functionality, and utilising the appropriate information inside the response data to display on a webpage, utilising a JavaScript snippet.  The challenge with this, came with where I wanted to add this data - inside an accordion as an additional item.  
It was not that straightforward to mimic it's visuals nor behaviour, as the class setup is quite extensive, and I would not have been surprised if there is some coding functionality going on under the hood that I was just unable to re-create.  
I ended up obtaining close visuals, and full functionality, so the items displayed appropriated once said accordion item was expanded, and hidden when it was closed up.

After the day at SoC (first day of final project week!) , I finished up the code from yesterday, and gave last minute small adjustements so it was more readable (especially with a few dom manipulation variables!). I also added error handling that could be displayed on the web page (also via the snippet).   
  
I also decided to record a quick video, to practice my video editing skills - which also gave me a chance to get familiar with Da Vinci Resolve for the first time.  Note: First impressions, it's much more flexible than both clipChamp and OpenShot Editor.

During SoC, we transitioned from our initial planning phase, to setting out our Tech Stack, PWA, MVP and rough Wireframing.  

We spent quite a bit of time there due to having to edit our original vision, as our expectations of utilising an API from OS was quite restricting and we thought it would take a long time to manipulate it in a way that would solve our problem statement.

Today was our first build day. I took my role as lead and made sure we had a task list of issues made in github, and appropriately assigned to everyone.  I made sure everyone had a clear idea of what their priorities were and whether they had enough information to execute our tasks.  

We then divided and conquered, and I spent time helping my colleague with some initial tailwinding, and understanding our current code we'd been pulling down from other members as the merges to main came in.  
After some thorough navigation and liasing with the rest of my members at various intervals, I found some time in the evening to style our google places images - and that was no easy feat.  
Ultimately, I had to create containers to manipulate the images indirectly, and accept that the location information would not be displayed inside the boxes (as it affected the images too much). If everyone agrees, I will take the text outside of that component and display it underneath instead, if its needed.

Full on hackathon day today!  

I started by taking on one of my roles the nominated decision maker, which also allowed an easy format to drive our next steps, priorities and written issues that required populating, delegating and requesting a window for an update with other members.  

I then focused on updating the front-end with one of my team members for the day, and managed to get a clean and uniform visual display, in a format that suits mobile devices first.  

With the app in a good space by the EoD, I took responsibility to flesh out a detailed readme as one of the repo's final touches, ready to merge to main the folllowing morning.

Today was full on presentation planning and presentation day with an official webinar, to showcase in front of potential employers.  
I was fully knackered after that and a SoC online social, so I took the evening off to rest.

I had to take yesterday off, I was brain-dead, exhausted, not just from the week at SoC but from everything that was going on outside of that too (what timing!).  

Today I started with getting some code articulation practice with a fellow developer, with my code-snippet I created a few days prior.  

I then spent the rest of my coding session creating a lesson plan for a Python tutorial - and also created the project exercise in question.

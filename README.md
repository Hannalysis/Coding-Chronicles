After finishing up the module from the bootcamp for this week, I wanted to take it easy after another intense week of React.  

I decided to branch off on our hackathon project, to fix a screen sizing issue that was occurring on one of my teammates' monitor.  With more freedom on the jsx files, I was able to manage the container layout, and centre everything appropriately, to give  
the header more space to move down (as it was clipping off on their screen). This should fix the issue, but it also made me realise I could add a media query so if the height was below a certain sizing on the viewport, it would disappear, giving the rest of our app  
more breathing space.  
  
After pushing that branch up to the remote repo; I realised I'd like to have those changes myself, so I forked the repo with that unmerged branch.  Which made me realise, I had no idea how to merge it manually, as the github website does not prompt a pull request on a forked repo  
with an unmerged branch. So I had to clone this forked repo, checkout the branch and ensure I had those changes locally, checkout main again, and then use the 'git merge branchname' command, and then push those changes back to the remote repo on main.

Same feeling as yesterday, I'm still winding down from a couple of intense weeks, so using today as a chill winding down coding session.  

I wanted to take the content of my CV (which I've been gradually updating in draft form) and transfer it to a fresh, modern template; therefore I've opened a repo and decided to design my own template.  
  
Revisiting my basic CSS skills, I managed to create a stylised header, and filled the basic wireframe for each section so far.

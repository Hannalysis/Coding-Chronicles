After finishing up this week's module in SoC on AI & Data, I looked into utilising JavaScript snippets, and recapped on certain aspects of Chrome's DevTools.

I spent today creating fetch functionality, and utilising the appropriate information inside the response data to display on a webpage, utilising a JavaScript snippet.  The challenge with this, came with where I wanted to add this data - inside an accordion as an additional item.  
It was not that straightforward to mimic it's visuals nor behaviour, as the class setup is quite extensive, and I would not have been surprised if there is some coding functionality going on under the hood that I was just unable to re-create.  
I ended up obtaining close visuals, and full functionality, so the items displayed appropriated once said accordion item was expanded, and hidden when it was closed up.

After the day at SoC (first day of final project week!) , I finished up the code from yesterday, and gave last minute small adjustements so it was more readable (especially with a few dom manipulation variables!). I also added error handling that could be displayed on the web page (also via the snippet).   

I also decided to record a quick video, to practice my video editing skills - which also gave me a chance to get familiar with Da Vinci Resolve for the first time.  Note: First impressions, it's much more flexible than both clipChamp and OpenShot Editor.

During SoC, we transitioned from our initial planning phase, to setting out our Tech Stack, PWA, MVP and rough Wireframing.  
We spent quite a bit of time there due to having to edit our original vision, as our expectations of utilising an API from OS was quite restricting and we thought it would take a long time to manipulate it in a way that would solve our problem statement.

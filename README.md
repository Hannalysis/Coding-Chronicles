After updating my site with the latest react and react-dom packages, I thought this would be a good moment to reflect on this week (in-between Christmas tasks!). 

I've spent most of this week continuing to revisit the fundamentals of CSS, partly due to the fact that the majority of my learnings from that stack have been from projects and challenges, rather than textbook form.  
So, when I do come across something I'm grateful for the context, to the why, rather than just the what.  

I've recently been using Codecademy's Front-End Engineer Career path course to support this.  Importantly, I've learnt the design technique of 'Skeuomorphism'; when styling is applied to an element (ie a button), it's trying to imitate something akin to real life to ease usabiilty for consumers.  However, it's also worth noting that there is merit to it's counterpart, 'Flat' design, where your userbase is more aware of the interactions within your product/platform.  

On a smaller scale, I came across a few property types in CSS I havn't encountered before; letter-spacing, word-spacing & text-transform.  
This enlighted me to make a small tweak in one of my front-end mentor projects, where I had previously hard coded spaced capitalised characters; the refactor is inside <a href='https://github.com/Hannalysis/front-end-mentor-product-preview-card-component/pull/4/files'>this</a> PR.

It's been a difficult week to allocate as much time on coding as I usually do.  However, it's been great to have very focused sessions & aims, to get some much needed continuation on my latest Frontend Mentor (FEM) challenge; the Fylo data storage component. 

I can happily say today I've finished with the mobile-styling implementation; and that branched is now merged to main.  Desktop to follow shortly.  
A couple of CSS property learnings I've had this week so far: 
- There is a CSS math function called clamp(), and it's been amazing to utilise it to give me flexibility and restrict sizing when I need it to.
- Using opacity primarily on a container can lead into a trap; as all the children will be unable to override it. So keeping opacity to colour values is much safer.

I've also been introduced to Adobe's colour wheel this week, which has been a great alternative to experiment with harmonic colour schemes using it's toolkit.

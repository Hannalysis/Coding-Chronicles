Despite a shorter study week, as of today I managed to complete the 'Analyzing Data in Tableau' course in Datacamp.  
This was the last prerequisite course on the Tableau career track, meaning I can finally start the 'Data Visualization in Tableau' course.  

I'm pleasantly surprised how much I got out of that course, namely the chapter 'Mapping Analysis'. Working with analysing geodata was directly relevant to my WoC project, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it can do to enhance it's visual output options.  
  
I also went back to an old React flashcards project, to replace the original form component and utilise the react-hook-form library instead.

Naturally, after waiting a week to post an update, I do a bit of additional study today and I've learnt just as much in a shorter period of time!  

Firstly, I completed the second chapter of the 'Data Visualization in Tableau', which focused on improving visualisations to make them more readable, and removing redundant or repeated information where necessary.   
I also learnt how to embed a tooltip visualisation within another visualisation, as well as using an url object on a dashboard to access more information from a site with a hover action.  This is inspiring me with my follow up data projects.  

And last but not least, I implemented an image decoration behind a set of buttons on the colab quiz project, and in front of a gradient background. I struggled a bit at first with the placement (not the layer), until I realised I could use the absolute CSS property to stop the pushing and pulling of other elements!

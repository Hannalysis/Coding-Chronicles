Despite a shorter study week, as of today I managed to complete the 'Analyzing Data in Tableau' course in Datacamp.  
This was the last prerequisite course on the Tableau career track, meaning I can finally start the 'Data Visualization in Tableau' course.  

I'm pleasantly surprised how much I got out of that course, namely the chapter 'Mapping Analysis'. Working with analysing geodata was directly relevant to my WoC project, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it can do to enhance it's visual output options.  
  
I also went back to an old React flashcards project, to replace the original form component and utilise the react-hook-form library instead.

I have been quiet on my personal coding learning journey for the last few weeks, as I wanted to focus my efforts at work whilst there was a major event we needed the project to be ready for, and I was already learning so much about being a Back-End developer from the experience. 

So after completing my contract (and giving myself a much needed break), I am ready to get back to it. I have made so many plans and items that require actioning.  

My priority today returned me to my colab project with my mentor - whom I managed to have a catch-up with earlier this week. I finally got to discuss my UI/UX wireframes I'd created in Figma for our 1st round/game mode of choice and decide our overall app approach.
So today I created a Github project and added all tasks we have agreed to action for our MVP/MS1. 
I've already noticed the limitations of Github projects compared to my previous experience with Jira, and had to create some workarounds (mostly by making custom fields that act as tags/labels).  

I then actioned my first task, by researching into appropriate folder hierarchy structures for our repo, and is now review ready - so I can then implement this as the next step.

Due to early confirmation for the folder structure suggestion, I spent today creating the scaffolding for the colab project. This also included converting the App.css file to be modular, which then caused me to need to update the App.tsx file so the styling would persist.  
It also made me realise that the React Vite boilerplate utilises global CSS inside the App.css file, so I moved the culprits to the index.css file and made an additional styling property to justify the body's content to be centred once more.  

With a PR awaiting review to hopefully merge and close the relevant Github issue, I decided to leave it there for today as it's very hot and my PC is not helping!

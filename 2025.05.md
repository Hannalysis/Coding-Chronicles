As mentioned yesterday, I wanted to commence the Front-End Mentor challenge, the results-summary-component.  

I had no intentions to finish or rush to completion, but I am timing my progress for curiousity.  The reason I do not want to pressure myself for swiftness on this occasion, as I want to use this as an opportunity to really improve my code structure, and ensure it's clean and easy to read.  
I can revert to utilising prettier, however I've not set it automatically in hopes that I can train good behaviours for myself without over-relying on that tool.  
I also want to ensure I'm using appropriate element types inside the html (rather than just reverting to div at every opportunity).  

With 25 minutes of time allocated to just the planning process, this really helped me confirm how I wanted to containerise the component, what elements are best to use, and how it would be responsive from mobile to desktop.  
I decided to utilise the grid format; 1x2 for mobile, and 2x1 for desktop.  I also ensured the component was sitting in a main container, and the two containers within were using sections.  

After a bit of intial formatting on the results-container and its text content, including adding a gradient background to match the example, I decided to leave it there for today.

After a bank-holiday break, I started my return to coding with some minor tweaks to my site.  This included deleting redundant comments, re-ordering my project carousel and adding additional tech stack icons, and adding additional meta tags.  

I then returned to working on the results-summary-component.

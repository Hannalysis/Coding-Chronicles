Turns out, that small cold evolved into a full-blown flu! Not my favourite start to the year, however I'm finally over the worst of it and ready to lightly get back to the coding journey :) 

After being recommended the Frontend Unicorn ebook (amongst many others!), I'm starting today with a nice chill reading session over most of the introductory sections.  
Going forward, my aim is to read 1 or 2 chapters to start my day before going into any practical learning or project sessions.  

Note: I seem to have not mentioned that I learnt what kerning is at some point during the festive period, so writing it here - the spacing between two letters in a text. Most typefaces are well-designed that it's not a concern, however it can be useful when for editing header or title text.

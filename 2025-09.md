Today I'm feeling happy about opening a PR in the colab project, I just need to await a review from my comrade then main will have some functional content!  I also updated the documentation, including adding a component/file tree so we can both have a high level view of the flow within our React project.  

So this afternoon I returned my focus to the career track in Datacamp, 'Data Engineer in Python'.  I completed the last chapter of the 'Cleaning Data in Python' course, which had me focusing on exercises for comparing strings, utilising the thefuzz and recordlinkage libraries.  
I went through the motions of calculating similarities of strings, generating pairs, drawing comparisons and finally linking them back to the DataFrame.  
I then started the optional cleaning data project on Datacamp, where I split the data into 3 separate dataframes, and have managed to clean up the first one of 3.  I aim to continue and finish this exercise tomorrow morning.

Today I'm feeling happy about opening a PR in the colab project, I just need to await a review from my comrade then main will have some functional content!  I also updated the documentation, including adding a component/file tree so we can both have a high level view of the flow within our React project.  

So this afternoon I returned my focus to the career track in Datacamp, 'Data Engineer in Python'.  I completed the last chapter of the 'Cleaning Data in Python' course, which had me focusing on exercises for comparing strings, utilising the thefuzz and recordlinkage libraries.  
I went through the motions of calculating similarities of strings, generating pairs, drawing comparisons and finally linking them back to the DataFrame.  
I then started the optional cleaning data project on Datacamp, where I split the data into 3 separate dataframes, and have managed to clean up the first one of 3.  I aim to continue and finish this exercise tomorrow morning.

After a bit of an admin morning, I got an update from my colab partner to inform me they've reviewed the PR and given me the go ahead to merge it.  I had a few follow-up tweaks and suggestions to refactor so I've added those to the task pool, and will intend to address those before our verbal catch-up early next week!  
While I was within Github projects, I decided to tidy-up the tasks, and add a few bespoke labels for easy filtering.  

This had not left me much of an afternoon left, but I've managed to continue working on the Datacamp project exercise...

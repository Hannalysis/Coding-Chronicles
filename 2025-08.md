Today I needed a bit of a palette cleanser, so I decided to go back Front End mentor, and continue the results-summary-component challenge.  

It didn't take me long to refamiliarise myself with where I'd got to and how the styling was working due to the container naming conventions I'd used.  I managed to complete the summary section of the component, which included colouring and spacing each sub section and utilising CSS variables for readability.
The button implementation was not too bad apart from getting the size to align with the summary sub sections, until I created a container for the button and sub-sections only.  A few other bespoke tweaks for desktop versus mobile and it's in a good enough spot to deploy, so it's now hosted on [github pages](https://hannalysis.github.io/front-end-mentor-results-summary-component/). I intend make a few more adjustments (including making score adjustments dynamically with the data json file), other than that, my next priority is to get a thorough readme created for this exercise.

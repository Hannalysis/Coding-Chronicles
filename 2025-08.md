Today I needed a bit of a palette cleanser, so I decided to go back Front End mentor, and continue the results-summary-component challenge.  

It didn't take me long to refamiliarise myself with where I'd got to and how the styling was working due to the container naming conventions I'd used.  I managed to complete the summary section of the component, which included colouring and spacing each sub section and utilising CSS variables for readability.
The button implementation was not too bad apart from getting the size to align with the summary sub sections, until I created a container for the button and sub-sections only.  A few other bespoke tweaks for desktop versus mobile and it's in a good enough spot to deploy, so it's now hosted on [github pages](https://hannalysis.github.io/front-end-mentor-results-summary-component/). I intend make a few more adjustments (including making score adjustments dynamically with the data json file), other than that, my next priority is to get a thorough readme created for this exercise.

I spent yesterday telling myself I was only doing admin; so I created my readme for my results-summary-component challenge.  Then I looked at my initial FE Mentor challenge I'd attempted in January, and decided it was a good time to implement the mobile-design element of the challenge.  
 
What I was not expecting, is how difficult I found it to pull styling from implementing desktop first, into mobile (after getting accustommed to mobile-first). I thought I could just change the flex into a grid and other styling changes would be minor.  But I found I had a fair amount of redundant styling properties on the original implementation, and I hadn't yet heard of CSS custom properties so there were many adjustments to make. So much that it basically bled heavily into todays work!  

I did manage to get that all commited and pushed in a branch, alongside an updated readme, PR made and merged, and is live on [this github page](https://hannalysis.github.io/front-end-mentor-product-preview-card-component/).  

That left me a little bit of time to start my datacamp course on 'Database Design'. I managed to complete the first chapter which covered OLTP & OLAPs and suggestions for when you'd utilise each processing approach, data types and data storages, and defining a data model.

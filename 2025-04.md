After a full day of designing, and a limited timeframe, I wanted to utilise AI to help me build the foundations of this site. However, the one I rely on will not allow for further prompts until 2 days time. Not great timing. So I opted to try a different one.  
Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the alternative, as despite carefully crafting an essay prompt, the AI only implemented each component one at a time, and it costed me a message to agree for it to create the new component.  And I'm looking at the results for what I have so far, thinking, it's alot to edit.  

Doable of course, but not in a day (not to a degree where's its demoable). Time frame aside now, this may develop into a side project of it's own, and be a foundation for improving my motion animation skills in the near future instead.  

With that in mind, I decided to end the day with with pomodoro's of 'Learning TypeScript'. I've now completed the section on type narrowing, and using examples of type guarding with if / else or if and simply return statements. 86% Complete.

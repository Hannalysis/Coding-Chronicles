Last couple of weeks ended up being especially busy, and I only managed to get a day to work on my own personal project.  

However, this week has a lot more scope for progression! So today, I started with continuing the Relic colab project! I spent most of the day working on the MVP wireframe and design in figma.  

I deliberately wanted to be careful and ensure spacing is appropriate thanks to the grid layout, that reusable components are created and stored into their own page, along with design tokens, templates, sizing & typography details.  

I'm pleased to say I managed to finish the MVP figma design for the suggested page (minus an element that's very much out of scope for now), including renaming all layers/items so it's easy to follow (I've learnt from looking at certain community figmas that consistently renamed items are so much easier to follow and understand for implementation).  I even managed to create a progress node bar component in figma, which I previously only really knew how to do in CSS.
